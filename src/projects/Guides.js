            <p>From our annual research, we learned the majority of MongoDB users visit 
                Docs to get guidance on a specific task. We also learned that 50% of our 
                users identify as learners.</p>
            <p className='mt-16'>At the same time, we also saw MongoDB Guides rise to the 5th 
            most visited property in all of our documentation. Why? Even though this part of the 
            site hadnâ€™t been touched in 5 years, this happened because it was giving the people 
            the task-centric content they needed - even if it was at the smallest adequate level (trust 
            me - our users always gave us an earful during user interviews). But, to point out the obvious, 
            â€˜smallest adequate levelâ€™ does not cut it.</p>
            <p className='mt-16'>To create an intentional strategy tailored for our learners and 
            optimize on the organic growth of the property, I led the transformation of our static Guides 
            page to a step by step learning experience.</p>

            <h4>Content Strategy</h4>
            <p className='mt-8'>Many of the current pain points were due to a lack of content strategy. It was extremely important to name a lead that would be 
            responsible for identifying and driving an intentional content approach.</p>
            <p className='mt-16'>The director soon identified someone he trusted to lead the content vision on guides. Next, I led the 3 of us through a series of 
            brainstorming sessions to kickoff the content strategy objective.</p>
            <p className='mt-16'>We discussed topics such as:</p>
            <ul className='mt-16'>
                <li>What content should live on Guides?</li>
                <li className='mt-8'>How much guidance and opinion should we provide the user?</li>
                <li className='mt-8'>Whatâ€™s the difference between guides, tutorials, and how-tos?</li>
                <li className='mt-8'>Should the guides have a standard format?</li>
                <li className='mt-8'>What should the tone of voice be?</li>
                <li className='mt-8'>Are we teaching concepts? Or demonstrating tasks?</li>
            </ul>
            <div className='quote-container marginCenter mt-40 mb-40'>
                <p className='quote mb-0'>Guides specifically houses step by step procedures on how to complete specific getting started with MongoDB tasks.</p>

            <p className='mt-16'>After identifying the content strategy, this team then moved into completing a content audit, updating procedures, and writing net-new guides.</p>

            <h4 className='mt-80'>Design</h4>
            <p className='mt-8'>Moving in parallel with the content worked, I kicked off the design process.</p>
            <p className='mt-16'>Luckily, the content strategy was identified, giving me a direction to move off of.</p>
            <p className='mt-16'>I started off with primary research. Because 50% of our users identify as learners and we honed in on a content strategy around getting started, I 
            really worked to understand how learners were currently getting started with MongoDB and what pain points existed. Some key takeaways were:</p>

        <div className='text-container marginCenter mt-32'>
            <p className='mt-8'>Afterwards, I dove into sketching ideas and evaluating different concepts. I explored ideas such as how to clarify the â€˜end of getting started,â€™ how 
            to provide a sense of guidance, or how to deliver learning materials in different methods.</p>

        <div className='text-container marginCenter mt-32'>
            <p>After several rounds of feedback, I decided to narrow in on 2 concepts:</p>
            <ul className='mt-8'>
                <li>A chapter by chapter learning approach</li>
                <li className='mt-8'>Exchangeable learning blocks</li>

            <h4>Maintenance Planning</h4>
            <p className='mt-8'>To maintain the health of the property, a key part of this project was identifying 
            a maintenance plan. Other teammates wanted to contribute to the Guides corpus, which was amazing, but we 
            wanted to make sure we didnâ€™t repeat old mistakes of mixed and unmaintained content. I pulled together a 
            working group of key content players for again, a series of brainstorming sessions.</p>
            <p className='mt-16'>As a result, we aligned on:</p>
            <ul className='mt-8'>
                <li>A writing process for future net-new guides.</li>
                <li className='mt-8'>An intake process for guides that previously lived on other MongoDB sites.</li>
                <li className='mt-8'>A yearly review cycle to ensure all content was up to date.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className='mt-80'>Measuring success</h2>
            <p className='mt-8'>To measure success towards our project goal, I ensured the measurement of a couple KPIs.</p>
